ClearSight
======================
A C# (.Net4.6) based hobby engine project. Mostly rendering.
Meant primarily for my personal enjoyment and to satisfy my occasional curiosity about design issues. Also, I hope to use it as a base for rendering experiments in the future.

Some parts of this project's code are inspired by [ezEngine](http://ezengine.net/), an open source C++ engine which I hold in high regard (you should try it!).
