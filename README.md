ClearSight
======================
A C# (.Net4.6) based hobby engine project.
Meant primarily for my personal enjoyment and to satisfy my occasional curiosity about design issues.

Overview
----------------------
todo

Third Party Software & Relations
----------------------
Parts of this project's code are heavily inspired by [ezEngine](http://ezengine.net/),
a open source C++ engine which I hold in high regard (you should try it!).

Dependencies:
... none so far, but this will change soon ;-)

Licensing
----------------------
It's MIT license! So help yourself and copy whatever you want as long as you mention me by including the [license](/license.txt) :)
